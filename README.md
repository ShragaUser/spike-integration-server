### Where to personalize code? 
This template is Mostly Generic Express.js api. 

All Spike handling code is in: ```./server/utils/getToken```

All routing and enpoint handling is in: ```./server/middleware/routeMiddleware```

All redis handling code is in: ```./server/utils/redishandler```

#### This template utilizes [blueai-redis-cache-middleware](https://www.npmjs.com/package/blueai-redis-cache-middleware) - usage of this library is optional. default routing function use it but can be changed any time: 

blueai-redis-cache-middleware initialization is in: ```./server/utils/cacheHandler``` it exports a cacheWrapper Function:
* cacheWrapper accepts a function(req,res,next) that return a value of {err, respone}.
* its meant to cache responses from external apis (using axios) and serve cached response when available
* it parses req.body + req.path to create a unique key for any request
* cache is updated with every request ( meaning every second request client recieves response from the last request)
* usage is to your discretion!
